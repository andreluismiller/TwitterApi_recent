# TwitterApi_recent

## Description
Project developed to pull me in touch with Twitter API v2, retriving recent tweets about the conflict in eastern europe, between Russia and Uckraine.

### Seach criteria
The retrived tweets use "...search/recent" endpoint, having portuguese language and keywords "guerra (russia OR ucrania)" as params, since the future plan is to conduct a sentiment analysis on the data (write into a csv file) to get a panoramical perspective of the subject opinions.
